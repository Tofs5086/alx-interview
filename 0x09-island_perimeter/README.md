**Island Perimeter**  
This project includes coding challenges typically asked in interviews.

**Tasks to Complete**

**0. Island Perimeter**  
File `0-island_perimeter.py` contains a module with a function defined as `def island_perimeter(grid):`, which computes and returns the perimeter of the island represented in the `grid`. The requirements are as follows:

- `grid` is a list of lists containing integers:
  - `0` represents water.
  - `1` represents land.
- Each cell in the grid is a square with side lengths of 1.
- Cells are connected either horizontally or vertically, not diagonally.
- The grid is rectangular, and neither its width nor height exceeds 100.
- The grid is entirely surrounded by water.
- There is only one island or none at all.
- The island does not contain any "lakes" (water that is enclosed and not connected to the surrounding water).
